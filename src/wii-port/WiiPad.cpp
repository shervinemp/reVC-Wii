// --- the pointer as a camera ------------------------------------------------
// The hard part of a pointer on this engine: IR is ABSOLUTE and BOUNDED, it says
// where on the screen the player is aiming, while the camera is RELATIVE and
// UNBOUNDED, it wants how far to turn and can turn forever.  Differencing
// successive pointer positions is the obvious translation and it is wrong in a
// specific way: the total camera travel available becomes one screen width, so
// aiming into a corner and holding swings the view until the pointer clamps and
// then stops.  There is no way to keep turning without sweeping back and forth.
//
// So in game the offset from the centre of the screen is read as a RATE instead:
// direction and speed, not distance.  Hold the Wiimote up and right and the
// camera keeps going up and right, faster the further out it points.  In a MENU
// the pointer stays absolute, because there it really is a cursor and aiming at
// an option has to put the cursor on that option.
//
// Neutral is the centre of the screen, always.  Latching it to wherever the
// player happened to be aiming sounds friendlier and is not: close a menu with
// the pointer in a corner and the whole mapping is half a screen out, with
// nothing on screen to say that it happened or how to undo it.
//
// All three of these are fractions of half the screen HEIGHT, including the
// horizontal one -- see irPointerRate for why not each axis' own extent.

//               rate camera feel like it is fighting the player.
//   curve       how much of the response is linear rather than quadratic.  The
//               quadratic part is what keeps small offsets slow enough to aim
